# Sea Surface Temperature Prediction with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based framework for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) using historical oceanographic data. The model is built with PyTorch and trained on NetCDF-formatted SST datasets. It is designed for applications in marine heatwave detection, climate monitoring, and ocean forecasting.

## Project Structure


## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Let me know:
- your actual GitHub repo name (if you'd like to include the real link),
- the dataset source (e.g. ECCO2, NOAA),
- any model details (e.g. “LSTM-based architecture”),
- and your email (if you want it shown).

Happy to customize it further for your project!
